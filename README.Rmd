Single-cell datasets are growing in size rapidly, posing challenges as well as opportunities to biology researchers. `ondisc` (short for "on-disk single cell") is an R package that empowers users to easily and efficiently analyze large-scale single-cell data. `ondisc` makes computing on large-scale single-cell data **FUN**:

- **Fast**: `ondisc` is powered by several novel, highly efficient algorithms and data structures. All low-level code is written in C++ or C for maximum performance.
- **Universal**: `ondisc` runs on all platforms, from laptops to supercomputers. `ondisc` works seamlessly when the size of the data exceeds the amount of available memory. 
- **Ntuitive**: `ondisc` leverages ideas from functional programming, making it simple for R users users to pick up and incorporate into their code.

Take a look at the [tutorials](https://timothy-barry.github.io/ondisc/articles/tutorial_odm_class.html) on the [package website](https://timothy-barry.github.io/ondisc/index.html).
