Description: Single-cell datasets are large and growing in size as sequencing costs drop. 
    The ondisc package is designed to facilitate large-scale computing on single-cell expression 
    data by providing access to expression matrices out-of-memory. ondisc is functional (i.e., 
    all objects are persistent) and efficient (i.e., algorithms are theoretically optimal 
    in time).
